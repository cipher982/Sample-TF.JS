# TensorFlow.js Demo: Grapeshot URL Classification

Using neural networks in TensorFlow to predict a webpage Grapeshot label and run it all in TensorFlow.JS

This example uses custom word embeddings and dense neural layers based in TensorFlow to train a natural language model (NLP) model based on scraped text from a large collection of webpages scraped from recent URLs seen from the Requests data. The model is trained to replicate the Grapeshot URL classification and runs fully in Javascript from within the browser. 

To launch the demo, do

```sh
yarn
yarn watch
```
